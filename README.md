# ProcessWire Comments Manager

Manage all comments field data in chronological order. Provides a simpler interface for managing comments vs. the page-based comment editor.

Assuming you have one or more comments fields installed (FieldtypeComments), this module installs a page on your Setup menu in the admin where you can manage the comments. 

### Features include:

- Easily find the latest comments needing approval or moderation.
- Shows comments from all pages on 1 screen, in chronological order.
- Enables you to change the status of any comment, edit the text or delete. 
- Filtering by status/type, cite, email or IP address. 

### To install

Place all of the files for this module in the directory /site/modules/ProcessLatestComments/ and *check for new modules* in Admin > Modules.
